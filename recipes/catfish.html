    <!--Description of the recipe-->
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Southern Fried Catfish is golden brown on the outside and flaky and delicious on the inside. Seasoned through and through, 
            it&apos;s the perfect recipe for when you want a good piece of fried fish. Fried fish is a staple among the Black community in the United States 
            and it&apos;s a vital part of African-American culinary traditions. Many celebrations call for a fish fry where pieces of fish are 
            seasoned and deep-fried until golden brown.</p>
